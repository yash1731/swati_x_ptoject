Feature: Create a SINGLE SELL/BUY order that doesn't match an existing BUY/SELL order - equal quantity, different price
  As a trader
  I want to create a single order that does not match an existing order in price
  So I can have a quote for the quantity I want to sell/buy

  Background:
    Given I have received the spot price for a "specific symbol" from the Market Data Service

  @noPriceMatchA @cancelOrder
  Scenario: Create a SELL order (5620 LTCUSD @58) when a BUY order (5620 LTCUSD @57) exists - Equal Quantity but higher SELL price
    When I create a Single BUY order as market maker A - createSingleOrderBuy
    And I create a matching SELL order as trader B - CreateSellOrderNoPriceMatchA
    And I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader A
    Then I should get the quote which should contain a bid and an offer value
    When I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader B
    Then I should get the quote which should contain a bid and an offer value

  @PriceMatchA
  Scenario: Create a SELL order (5620 LTCUSD @55)when a BUY order (5620 LTCUSD @57) exists - Equal Quantity but lower SELL price
    When I create a Single BUY order as market maker A - createSingleOrderBuy
    And I create a matching SELL order as trader B - CreateSellOrderNoPriceMatchB
    And I search for the executed SELL order - SearchCreateSellOrderNoPriceMatchB
    Then I should be able to see the BUY order with the order status as "Executed"
    When I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader A
    Then I should get the quote which should contain an empty bid and an empty offer value with a status of "Open"
    When I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader B
    Then I should get the quote which should contain an empty bid and an empty offer value with a status of "Open"
