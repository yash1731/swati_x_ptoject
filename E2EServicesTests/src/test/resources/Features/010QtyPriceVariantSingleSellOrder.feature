Feature: Create a SINGLE SELL order not matching an existing BUY order - different quantity, different price
  As a trader
  I want to create a single SELL order that does not match an existing BUY order in price and quantity
  So I can have a quote for the quantity I want to sell

  Background:
    Given I have received the spot price for a "specific symbol" from the Market Data Service

  @SellVariantA @cancelOrder
  Scenario: Create a SELL order (5520 LTCUSD @58) when a BUY order (5620 LTCUSD @57) exists - Higher SELL Price but lower SELL Quantity
    When I create a Single BUY order as market maker A - createSingleOrderBuy
    When I create a matching SELL order as trader B - createSingleOrderSell
    And I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader A
    Then I should get the quote which should contain a bid and an offer value
    When I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader B
    Then I should get the quote which should contain a bid and an offer value

  @SellVariantB @cancelOrder
  Scenario: Create a SELL order (5620 LTCUSD @55)when a BUY order (5500 LTCUSD @58) exists - Lower SELL Price but higher SELL Quantity
    When I create a Single BUY order as trader A - CreateBuyOrderQtyMatchA
    And I create a matching SELL order as trader B - CreateSellOrderNoPriceMatchB
    When I submit a quote request via the Quote Service for trader B
    Then I should get the quote which should contain an offer and an empty bid
    And the status of the offer should be "PartiallyExecuted"
